I looked for many themes around Wordpress and Googled a lot. It was easy to find good looking themes, but most of them were not proffessional and half of them were not able to reflect the luxury that agency wants to put in the mind of clients.
To attract the clients and engage them the UI should be beautiful and easy at the same time, user should not feel any discomfort in interacting.
In this theme, I found that A hero widget with menu bar integrated with it, looks beautiful at the same time it brings normal experience to user.
Plus one major point was somehow the pill buttons, which looks far better than the good old square primary colored ones.
The simplicity of website's design reflects the professional status of organization, that's why whithout thinking more I chose Mesmerize.
